# Cycle-2
Snake
Description -I recreated the classic game of Snake

Dependancies - Eclipse was the only way I could run it properly

Uses - To have some fun and relive the past

Future Developement - The future developement for this specific game is very slim. The few things I could think of would be adding a timer, having a system of tracking highscores, and cleaning up the look/display of the game
